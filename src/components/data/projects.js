        about: "Adventure Spark is a project that focuses on traveling again after a year and a half of staying home. Users are able to see points of interest on a world map using the Google Maps API, scroll around the map, and click on the map markers. Clicking on the points will make a call to the YouTube API and display a list of videos of things to do in that city.  Users can do a quick search for points on the map as well. Users can also keep a personal list of places they have visited and want to visit in the future on an adventure bucket list.",
